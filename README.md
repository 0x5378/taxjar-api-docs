# TaxJar API Docs

API documentation for TaxJar, powered by Slate and Middleman.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and simply run the following command:

```
bundle install
```

This should install the Ruby dependencies you need to get up and going.

## Development

To develop and preview the documentation locally, use the following Middleman command:

```
middleman server
```

This will watch for changes and compile them on the fly.

## Deployment

Deployment is still in flux, but in order to push a Middleman site you need to build it first:

```
middleman build
```
